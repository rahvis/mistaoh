            <p>
              In the bustling streets of Flatiron, New York, there's a warm corner where authentic Korean flavors meet
              heartfelt hospitality. This is Mista Oh, a family-run restaurant that brings the soul of Korea to
              Manhattan.
            </p>

            <p>
              The story begins with Mista Oh himself, a successful entrepreneur who built a thriving kimchi business in
              Korea. His kimchi, made with traditional recipes passed down through generations, became beloved across
              the country. But Mista Oh had a bigger dream—to share his passion for authentic Korean cuisine with the
              world.
            </p>

            <p>
              Together with his wife, Mista Oh made the bold decision to bring their culinary heritage to New York City.
              They chose the vibrant Flatiron district, a neighborhood known for its diverse food scene and welcoming
              community. In 2020, they opened the doors to Mista Oh restaurant, transforming their family recipes into a
              dining experience that feels like coming home.
